# Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that calculates the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights. It operates by iteratively exploring the nearest unvisited node, updating the shortest distance to neighboring nodes, and marking nodes as visited once processed.

The application shown in the video likely demonstrates the practical use of Dijkstra's Algorithm. Its purpose might be to visualize how the algorithm works step-by-step, to solve real-world problems like finding optimal routes, or to provide an educational tool for learning the algorithm.
